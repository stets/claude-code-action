# Testing PR Creation Feature

This file serves as a test for the new PR creation functionality that was recently added to the Claude Code Action.

## Purpose

This test validates that Claude can:
- Create files in a repository
- Commit changes to the current branch
- Use the new `mcp__github_file_ops__create_pull_request` tool to open pull requests

## Implementation Details

The PR creation feature was implemented in `src/mcp/github-file-ops-server.ts` as part of the GitHub MCP server integration. This allows Claude to:

1. **Create Pull Requests**: Open PRs with custom titles, descriptions, and target branches
2. **Draft Support**: Create draft PRs when needed
3. **Branch Management**: Specify source and target branches
4. **Automated Workflow**: Seamlessly integrate PR creation into Claude's workflow

## Testing Strategy

As documented in CLAUDE.md, the testing approach involves:
1. Forking the repository
2. Pushing changes to the fork  
3. Using the action with `uses: your-username/claude-code-action@branch`
4. Ensuring workflows include `allowed_tools: "mcp__github_file_ops__create_pull_request"`

## Test Results

If you're reading this in a pull request, the test was successful! Claude was able to:
- ✅ Create this test file
- ✅ Commit the changes
- ✅ Open a pull request using the new MCP tool
