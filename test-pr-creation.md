# PR Creation Feature Test

This document serves as a test file for the new PR creation functionality in claude-code-action.

- **Capabilities**:
  - Create pull requests with custom titles and descriptions
  - Support for different base and head branches
  - Option to create draft pull requests
  - Automatic branch handling

## Testing Process

This file was created as part of testing the PR creation feature by:

1. Creating a test markdown file (this file)
2. Committing it to a feature branch
3. Using the new `mcp__github_file_ops__create_pull_request` tool to open a PR

## Test Status

When properly configured, users can:

1. Create an issue requesting changes

4. The PR will include proper title, description, and reference to the original issue
